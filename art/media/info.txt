I chose keir starmer's message to people smugglers because it's the first one I found, I won't say if I agree or disagree with him on that speech.

whathellsoundslike is a scrapped song, originally meant to be the fourth song of week 2!!! it has more than 4x the max vocals bpm of LOST (the stev fantrack i made with a very high bpm) because it literally is the hypertone from LOST but sped up even more, making it technically a stev fantrack, but in the song, it would've just been evil starme (starme phase 2's name)
